                Indian Chicken Recipes: 
                If your favourite meat is chicken, then there are many lip-smacking options for you to go all out 
                and indulge. Among the many reasons that make Indian food a popular cuisine across the globe, 
                one is the use of aromatic spices that truly give our curries an additional edge. 
                Indian cooking offers a beautiful melange of herbs and spices, and if you are a fan of chicken, 
                the you are in for a special treat. There are many lip-smacking options for you to go all out 
                and indulge from a host of chicken dishes like the classic butter chicken to regional ones like 
                chicken chettinad or chicken 65. The list is really endless, and we are not complaining. 
                If you are wondering how to go about preparing mouth-watering Indian chicken dishes at home, 
                we've got you covered with some of the best chicken recipes here. Chicken is a great source of lean, 
                low fat protein. It is also packed with selenium, a chemical known for its anti-cancer properties.
                The skin of the chicken is known to contain the maximum fat; therefore skinned chicken is preferred by many.
                Buying chicken can be a tricky task to do. While buying chicken, make sure the chicken parts are 
                tender, moist and plump. The whole chicken and its parts should have a clean smell. 
                Before buying the chicken don't forget to check the date of package and don't buy if there is too 
                much volume of liquid in the package or the chicken seems to be sticky or smells suspicion. 
                The colour of the chicken however isn't really an accurate indicator of the quality as it varies 
                from region to region and depends on the breed and feed of it. However whatever the colour of the 
                chicken is, it shouldn't appear to be transparent or mottled.
                They’re a super crunchy, deeply savory, absolutely addictive snack, and probably one of the best things
                to ever come out of Taiwan. The other best thing being boba tea, of course. 
                I have many, many fond memories of late nights at boba tea places, munching on fried chicken, 
                Taiwanese scallion pancake beef rolls and drinking boba tea. There was even that one summer 
                after college when my friends and I would hangout every night, playing mahjong into the wee 
                hours of the morning. We were fueled by takeout bubble tea, beef rolls, Taiwanese popcorn 
                chicken, and the pure joy of youth. We were all working in-between kind of jobs that we didn’t 
                care about. All that mattered was our obsession with the clink of those green and white MJ tiles 
                and snacks. The best snack of all being Taiwanese popcorn chicken of course!
                Taiwanese popcorn chicken is an addictive night market snack from Taiwan. Like all good street foods, 
                it has made its way into the cultural fabric of Taiwan and is now served in restaurants in Taiwan and all over the world.   
                Just as with other extra crunchy deep fried chickens (Korean fried chicken, chicken karaage), 
                Taiwanese fried chicken is twice-deep fried: first in a low temperature oil to cook through, 
                then in a high heat oil to add crunch. As it comes out of the fryer, it’s tossed in a salt and 
                pepper seasoning and garnished with deep fried basil leaves. Oh, and of course I have to mention, 
                these little nuggets also come supersized as GIANT Taiwanese crispy fried chicken cutlets. 
                Those giant chicken steaks (sometimes bigger than your head!) are served either whole, in a bag, 
                that you can hold onto and bite, or cut up into pieces that you can eat with skewers or chopsticks.
                The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia. 
                Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male may be called a cockerel. 
                A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
                Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period 
                (4th–2nd centuries BC).Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
                Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,
                up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. 
                There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.
                Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but the clade 
                found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, 
                the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC. Fowl have been known in Egypt 
                since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, 
                Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.
                "Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] However, thanks to its usage on restaurant
                menus, it has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in American English. In older sources, 'chicken'
                as a species were typically referred to as 'common fowl' or 'domestic fowl'. 'Chicken' may also mean a 'chick
                Chickens are omnivores. In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and even animals as large as 
                lizards, small snakes, or young mice. The average chicken may live for 5-10 years, depending on the breed. The world's oldest 
                known chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 years according to the Guinness World Records.
